# README

This project contains multiple README files. The reason being to split the large amount of information into smaller junks.
This makes it easier - especially for this prototype/exercise - to quickly find the information you seek.

- `README-PROJECT-REQUIREMENTS.md`: The requirements that were given to me and define this project
- `README-PROJECT-PLAN.md`: The high-level plan I created before and during working on this project
- `README-DEV.md`: Gives a high-level overview over the project and the used tech stack
- `README-DEPLOY.md`: Explains the deploy process
- `README-PLANNED-FEATURES.md`: Gives some ideas for future improvements

This application uses some images that might need attribution. The sources are linked in `CREDITS.md`.
